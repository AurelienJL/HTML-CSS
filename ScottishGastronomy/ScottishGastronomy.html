					<h3>The Highland Games!</h3>
					<p class="article">Hielan games ur events held in spring 'n' summer in bonnie scotland as a wey o' celebrating scots 'n' celtic culchur, especially that o' th' scots hielands. Certain aspects o' th' games ur sae weel-kent as tae hae become emblematic o' scootlund, sic as th' bagpipes, th' kilt, 'n' th' heavy events, especially th' caber toss. Fur th' toss, a lang caber is staun upright 'n' hoisted by th' competitor wha balances it vertically haudin' th' wee'er end in his hauns. Then th' competitor runs tae th' future attempting tae toss it in sic a wey that it turns end ower end wi' th' upper end striking th' ground first. <br/> For mony hielan games festival attendees, th' maist memorable o' a' th' events at th' games is th' massing o' th' pipe bands. Normally held in conjunction wi' th' opening 'n' closing ceremonies o' th' games, as mony as 20 or mair pipe bands wull march 'n' speil th'gither. Th' result is a thunderous rendition o' scootlund th' brave or amazing grace, 'n' ither crowd-pleasing favourites.</p>
